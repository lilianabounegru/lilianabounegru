### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**lilianabounegru/lilianabounegru** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a Lecturer in Digital Methods at the Department of Digital Humanities, Kingâ€™s College London. Previously I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford). I am also a research associate at the Digital Methods Initiative (University of Amsterdam) and Sciences Po Paris mÃ©dialab. I co-founded the Public Data Lab, a network of research labs which seeks to facilitate research, democratic engagement and public debate around the future of the data society. 

My research interests include digital media, digital culture, digital journalism, inventive methods for new media research, digital methods, infrastructure studies, platform studies, issue mapping and controversy mapping. My work has been published in New Media & Society, Big Data & Society, Visual Communication and Digital Journalism. I am editor of The Data Journalism Handbook (Oâ€™Reilly Media, 2012; University of Amsterdam Press, 2019) translated into 12 languages, and co-investigator of A Field Guide to Fake News and Other Information Disorders, a transnational, multi-institutional research collaboration to develop digital methods to trace the circulation of political misinformation, junk news, memes and trolling practices online (also available in Chinese and Japanese).
